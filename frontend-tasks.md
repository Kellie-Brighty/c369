## üé® UI/UX Development Plan

### Phase 1: Core Component & Page Mockups (UI-Only)

Our initial focus is on building the visual components and page layouts with static data.

1.  **Project Setup**:

    - Initialize a new React.js project using Vite.
    - Integrate TailwindCSS for styling.
    - Set up the basic file structure as suggested in the project overview.

2.  **Theme and Styling**:

    - Implement a global light theme based on user preference.
    - Create a style guide for colors, typography, and spacing.

3.  **Component Development**:

    - `Navbar` component.
    - `Footer` component.
    - `Button` component (primary, secondary, etc.).
    - `Card` component for displaying info.
    - `Input` and `Form` elements.

4.  **Page Layouts (Static)**:
    - **Home Page**: Build the layout to display gym info, welcome message, and announcements.
    - **AI Gym & Health Assistant**: Create the chat interface UI, including message bubbles and input area.
    - **Whizpar (Anonymous Social Zone)**: Design the feed layout based on the provided screenshot, adapted for a light theme. This includes the post creation form and the discussion feed.
    - **Profile Page**: Mockup the user profile section showing membership status, personal info, and payment history.
